In addition to the APIs to access the resources, Poynt Cloud APIs also provide webhook notifications for various state changes of each resource to registered endpoints. Applications can register their own endpoints as webhook url for various events either programmatically or through the developer portal. In addition to sending notifications, Poynt APIs also provide a way to obtain a list of all notifications (from last 30 days) sent so the applications can always make sure they didnâ€™t miss any notifications that they would need to process.
